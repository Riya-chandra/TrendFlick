We have developed a smart web-based system that analyzes user-generated text using machine learning. It identifies the sentiment (positive or negative), predicts the potential likes and retweets, and suggests trending, relevant hashtags using Google’s Gemini API. This removes the guesswork and helps users create more impactful posts with higher chances of engagement.
